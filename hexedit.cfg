# Templates for using pg_hexedit options to limit annotation overhead follow

# Only emit whole-page annotations for leaf pages.
#
# Leaf pages are typically the great majority within nbtree, GiST, GIN, or
# SP-GiST index relations.  This option is useful with larger indexes in cases
# where only the root and other internal pages are of interest.

# Don't emit annotations for pages where the page header LSN is before
# argument.
#
# Tip: The latest checkpoint's REDO location can be a helpful generic cutoff
# point.  Run pg_controldata to get this information.  Be sure to do so before
# a convenience script issues its own CHECKPOINT.
